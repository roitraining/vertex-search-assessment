# Vertex AI Search and Conversation Assessment Starting Point

This Python Flask application is a starting point for the Deploying Search and Conversation Apps Assessment. To complete the assessment you need to implement the `search_data_store` and `format_response` functions in the `main.py` file. 

## To Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Change to the application folder (it should be the `vertex-search-assessment` folder) and run the following to create a Virtual Environment:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ~/genai-asessment
source ~/genai-asessment/bin/activate
```

3. Use Pip to install the prequisites

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To test the pogram run:

```
python main.py
```

5. If running in Google Cloud Shell, test your app using __Web Preview__ on port 8080. If running on your own computer browse to localhost:8080. 

## Completing the Code

To complete the code, you will have to complete __Task 1__ of the Assessment where the Python Programming Data Store was created.

Open `main.py` in your code editor (__Google Cloud Shell__ is recommended). The following fucntions are not implemented: 
* `search_data_store`
* `format_response`

There are comments in the code to give you some direction.
